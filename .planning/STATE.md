# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04 for v2.0)

**Core value:** A logged-in user opens the home page and sees a personalized "Up Next for you" row of anime they have not yet started — ranked by a transparent weighted-ensemble of signals. After completing an anime they enjoyed (score ≥ 7), a "Because you finished X" pin appears at the top of the row.
**Current focus:** v2.0 milestone started 2026-05-04. Defining requirements; roadmap pending.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 2026-05-04: v2.0 ensemble pattern locked over tiered fallback or two-stage retrieval+ranker — graceful cold-start, free admin breakdown, can grow into two-stage at scale without rewrite.
- 2026-05-04: Per-pool min-max normalization is the architectural fix that lets weights be coherent across signals at different raw scales.
- 2026-05-04: S6 score threshold ≥ 7 with fallback to ≥ 5 if pool too thin (more conservative than initial recommendation; cleaner signal).
- 2026-05-04: S6 Variant B (pinned tile) over Variant A (weight-shift) for v2.0 — more transparent, easier to debug; weight-shift deferred to v2.1 once pin CTR measured.
- 2026-05-04: Hybrid storage — Postgres precomputed signals + Redis 6h top-N cache. S6 seed update is synchronous on `MarkEpisodeWatched` so the pin appears immediately.
- 2026-05-04: Anonymous personalization deferred to v2.1; v2.0 anon users see population-only "Trending now" row.
- 2026-05-04: Pluggable `SignalModule` interface from day one — single seam for future signals (S7-S10).
- 2026-05-04: S5 TF-IDF time-weighting falls back to integer episode count for Kodik rows (84% of watch_history; duration_watched unreliable).

(Decisions carried from v1.0 are preserved in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table; this section tracks v2.0-fresh decisions only.)

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Signal | S9-implicit OP/ED affinity (skip-behavior) | Backlog (`.planning/backlog/REC-S9-implicit-op-ed-affinity.md`) | 2026-04-28 (during v2.0 design brainstorm) |

## v1.0 Carryover

- **Phase 7 follow-up (override-rate re-snapshot)** runs ≥ 7 d after Phase 6 deploy (≥ 2026-05-10) in parallel with v2.0 phases. Does NOT block v2.0.

## Session Continuity

Stopped at: v2.0 milestone started; PROJECT.md updated; STATE.md reset; defining requirements next.
