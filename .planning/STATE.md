# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** When a logged-in user opens an anime, the player loads on the correct episode in the combo (language + dub/sub + team + player) they actually want — without the user touching anything — and we can prove it with a single metric (auto-pick override rate).
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Instrumentation Baseline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Instrumentation Baseline)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap order: instrumentation FIRST so override-rate has a baseline before behavior changes ship
- Analytics audit (Phase 2) is read-only and may run in parallel with Phase 1
- `watch_progress.completed` is the single source of truth for "episode watched"; `anime_list.episodes` derives from it
- Strict no-cross-language and no-cross-dub/sub boundary (VAL-02) is preserved across all Tier 2 changes — must appear as a verified success criterion in Phase 6

### Pending Todos
